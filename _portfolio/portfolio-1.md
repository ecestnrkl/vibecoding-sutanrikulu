## Overview

At BMW Group, I developed scalable frontend interfaces for NLP and AI applications, making complex backend services accessible to non-technical users in an enterprise environment.

## The Challenge

Complex AI logic and machine learning models generated data that was difficult for business stakeholders to interpret and use effectively. The existing interface lacked clarity and usability.

**Key Problems:**
- Business users struggled to access AI-generated insights
- Existing UI didn't match mental models of non-technical stakeholders
- No clear visualization of complex NLP processing results

## My Approach

### User Research
Interviewed stakeholders to understand their workflows and pain points. Mapped current processes and identified friction points in data consumption.

### Architecture Design
Built component-based Angular application with clear separation of concerns. Designed modular component structure for scalability and maintainability.

### API Integration
Connected TypeScript frontend with Java backend services via REST APIs. Implemented efficient data fetching and state management patterns.

### Deployment
Containerized application using Docker for consistent deployment across environments. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

### Outcomes

- **40% faster** time-to-insight for business stakeholders
- Shipped features in **large-scale agile environment** with multiple teams
- Balanced **innovation with enterprise constraints** and legacy system integration
- Contributed to **production-grade codebase** used by internal stakeholders daily

## Key Learnings

Working at enterprise scale taught me the importance of:

- **Component architecture for maintainability**: Modular design enables teams to work independently
- **Clear documentation for team handoffs**: Essential in environments with rotating team members
- **Balancing new features with technical debt**: Understanding when to refactor vs. ship fast
- **Enterprise constraints as design parameters**: Working within existing systems, not against them
