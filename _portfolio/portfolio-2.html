## The Challenge

Users were dropping off during mobile comparison flows. The interface needed to be faster, clearer, and more conversational to match user expectations on mobile devices.

**Key Problems:**
- High bounce rates on mobile comparison flows
- Complex decision-making process overwhelming mobile users
- Lack of conversational guidance in user journey
- Inconsistent mobile experience across different comparison categories

## My Approach

### Product Discovery
Analyzed user behavior data and conducted mobile usability tests to identify friction points in the comparison journey.

### Feature Implementation
Built React-based chatbot interface for guided comparisons, simplifying complex decision-making processes through conversational UI.

### Optimization
A/B tested different mobile layouts and interaction patterns to validate improvements before full rollout.

### QA & Iteration
Rigorous testing across devices and browsers, followed by rapid iteration based on data feedback.

## Key Learnings

Consumer products taught me:

- **Speed and conversion as primary metrics**: Every millisecond and click matters at scale
- **Importance of rapid iteration and testing**: Ship, measure, learn, repeat
- **Balancing user needs with business goals**: Finding win-win solutions
- **Mobile-first thinking**: Touch targets, thumb zones, simplified interactions
- **Data-driven decision making**: Let user behavior guide product decisions
