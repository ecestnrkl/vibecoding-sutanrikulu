## The Bridge Builder {#about}

Creative Technologist and UX Engineer positioned at the intersection of design and engineering. I fill the critical gap between concept and production—where good designs often fail because they aren't implemented correctly.

**B.Sc. Informatics + Design** gave me technical depth. **M.Sc. UX Design** refined my strategic thinking. This combination is rare: I architect scalable frontend systems that respect both user needs and engineering constraints.

### Philosophy

**Fearless Exploration.** WebXR? Generative AI? New framework? I dive into docs, build prototypes, test hypotheses.

**Critical Evaluation.** I don't follow hype. My Bachelor thesis evaluated Design-to-Code tools systematically—testing whether new tech creates value or noise.

**Versatile Engineering.** React for component flexibility. Angular for enterprise structure. TypeScript always—type safety is non-negotiable at scale.

## Experience

### BMW Group — NLP & AI Applications
**Making enterprise AI accessible**

Developed scalable frontend interfaces bridging backend AI services with intuitive UX for non-technical stakeholders.

**Stack:** Angular, TypeScript, Java, Docker, REST APIs  
**Impact:** Shipped features in agile environment. Balanced innovation with enterprise constraints.

### Check24 — Product Management
**Shipping at consumer speed**

Chatbot implementation and mobile/web flow optimization on high-traffic comparison platforms.

**Stack:** React, Agile, QA Testing  
**Impact:** Translated business requirements into technical tickets. Learned consumer product pace.

---

## Tech Toolkit

**Frameworks:** React, Angular  
**Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, Python, HTML5, SCSS  
**Design:** Figma, Adobe XD, ISO 9241-210, Double Diamond  
**Emerging:** LLM/AI, WebXR, Unity/Unreal

My code is clean and component-based because I think in design systems. My designs are realistic because I know how code works.
